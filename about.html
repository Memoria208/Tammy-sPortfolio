Lora:

Normal weight 400 

Italic weight 400 

Montserrat:

Bold weight 700 

The &display=swap bit tells the browser to use a fallback font until the Google font loads, then “swap” it in to avoid long blank text rendering. -->

 <h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    Hi, I’m Tammy. I’m a Computer Science student who’s excited about learning how technology works and how it can make everyday life better. I’m especially interested in software development and data privacy — areas that let me solve problems and build things that help people.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love exploring new tools and picking up new skills as I grow in this field. So far, I’ve been working with Java, Spring, SQL, and Git, and I really enjoy seeing how everything fits together. I like to figure things out step by step and keep improving over time.

  <p>
    Technology is a big part of my life, but it’s not the only part. When I’m not studying, I love spending time with my adult daughter and my dog, going on long bike rides, and making lace jewelry. I find that being creative in different ways, whether through code or crafts, keeps me balanced and inspired.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
  <p>
    Looking ahead, I want to keep learning, building, and creating. My goal is to use what I’m learning to make technology more useful, safe, and understandable for everyone.
