Lora:

Italic weight 400 

Montserrat:

Bold weight 700 

The &display=swap bit tells the browser to use a fallback font until the Google font loads, then “swap” it in to avoid long blank text rendering. -->

    Hi, I’m Tammy Thomas. Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Computer Science student and this is the beginning of my journey. So far, I’ve become skilled in Java, Spring, SQL, API development, and GIT. I’ve only done a few projects, but this site will continue to expand over time as I continue to develop my skills. I know that there are always new things to learn in this field, and I’m here to keep learning and growing. This is where I plan to show off my skills and accomplishments in data privacy, software development and other related projects. Check out my About Page and take a look at my projects to learn more.

<div class="panel">
  <p>
    I believe it’s more important than ever to have strong data security systems in place for everyone who uses and stores data. I became interested in this field when I realized how little many people know about protecting their own information. I want to help ensure that everyone is safer now and in the future as technology evolves and new threats emerge. Securing data is essential to protecting our personal, professional, and financial lives
